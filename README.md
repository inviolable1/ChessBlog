Chess Blog by a self-confessed patzer, for anyone who loves the game.

Things to include:
1) About me
2) Single Page App
3) Tags (Puzzle, Beginner, Study) etc. - need to research how to do this. Also - Chess motifs/themes as a secondary tagging
4) Search bar - search keywords such as opponents, stalemates, famous games (text search)
5) comment using facebook account? 
6) Web traffic? 
7) Links - to playchess, ICC, other famous chess blogs
8) Idea - something similar to AngularJS
9) Enter posts in MySQL? Can you do HTML in there? 
10) Ajax - Load 5 posts per page, and only load more as user scrolls down (like Facebook)
