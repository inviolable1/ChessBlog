ChessBlog
=========

Chess Blog by a self-confessed patzer, for anyone who loves the game.

Things to include:
1) About me
2) Single Page App
3) Tags (Puzzle, Beginner, Study) etc. - need to research how to do this. Also - Chess motifs/themes as a secondary tagging
4) Search bar - search keywords such as opponents, stalemates, famous games (text search)
5) comment using facebook account? 
6) Web traffic? 
7) Links - to playchess, ICC, other famous chess blogs
8) Idea - something similar to AngularJS
9) Enter posts in MySQL? Can you do HTML in there? 
10) Ajax - Load 5 posts per page, and only load more as user scrolls down (like Facebook)

References - using database in a Single Page App etc.

*What I am thinking off for the blog is VERY similar to the Year of Moo page...

*How to get your SPA indexed by search engines
http://www.yearofmoo.com/2012/11/angularjs-and-seo.html

*Need to learn how to do the query thing and bringing things up from database

*Difference: When people do the search, its not just the title of the post that comes up, its the actual posts!
